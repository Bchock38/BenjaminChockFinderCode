| April 5    |   9-10pm    |                                                                                                                                                       I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| October 25 | 11:20-11:50 | Created file started looking at source code and csv files to understand wht code is suppose to do. Also started looking at hash maps and how they works since I feel like they will be important |
| October 30 |  9:00-9:45  |                                                                Started to create my own hash map type of function/code so that I could store all the querie data at the index of the hash of key |
| October 30 | 9:45-10:00  |                                                                                     Created new class duple for arraylist to store so I ca store but value and the key for in case of collisions |
| October 30 | 9:50-10:50  |                                                          Working on my queirie function, but for some reason my duple class isn't working/maybe I messed up my arrays trying to fix and solve it |
