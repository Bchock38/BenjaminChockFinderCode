| April 5     |    9-10pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                               I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| October 25  | 11:20-11:50  |                                                         Created file started looking at source code and csv files to understand wht code is suppose to do. Also started looking at hash maps and how they works since I feel like they will be important |
| October 30  |  9:00-9:45   |                                                                                                                        Started to create my own hash map type of function/code so that I could store all the querie data at the index of the hash of key |
| October 30  |  9:45-10:00  |                                                                                                                                             Created new class duple for arraylist to store so I ca store but value and the key for in case of collisions |
| October 30  |  9:50-10:50  |                                                                                                                  Working on my queirie function, but for some reason my duple class isn't working/maybe I messed up my arrays trying to fix and solve it |
| Novemeber 4 | 12:50 - 1:30 | Created new class hashmaps to make finder easier. Created all the instance variables for finder. Decieded to stick with an a rray of duples instead of a keys and values array. Finished creating my insert method and started to work on the get method |
| Novemeber 6 | 10:10- 10:30 |                                                                                                     finished doing resize and used the methods created in hashmaps to make finders make and queiries, but currently getting a stack overflow from resize |
| November 7  |  8:00-8:30   |                                                                                                                   Fixed all bugs but now not getting right key match. Not too sure why, but trying to go through my get method to see if thats the issue |
| November 7  |  8:30-9:00   |                                                                                     Found the bug turns out when I readline for my while loop it used on of the readlines so I was losing values now passes all, but test rpoducts where it's timing out |
